# MyReads Project

# Description

The goal of this project was to build a bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you have already read, currently reading, or want to read. The app also lets you search for a book in a limited database.

## How to Run

1. Make sure that the lasted version of Node.js is installed.
2. Clone repository or download `.zip` file.
3. Navigate to project folder.
4. Open terminal in project folder.
5. Install all project dependencies with `npm install`.
6. Start the development server with `npm start`.
7. Main page will open in default browser.

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
